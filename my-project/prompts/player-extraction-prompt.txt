Extract all player information from this image and return ONLY a valid JSON array. Do not include markdown, code blocks, or any other text.

**Required format:**
[
  {
    "name": "First Name + First Surname",
    "number": 7
  }
]

**Field rules:**
- name: First name + first surname ONLY. Be careful with compound names (e.g., "Josep Maria Rodríguez" -> "Josep Maria Rodríguez", "Juan Antonio Garcia" -> "Juan Antonio Garcia"). If player has multiple surnames (e.g. "Perez Garcia"), use only the first one. If not visible, use "Unknown Player"
- number: Jersey/dorsal number as integer. If not visible, use 0

**Important:**
- Return ONLY the JSON array, nothing else
- Do not wrap in markdown code blocks
- Do not include explanations
- Extract all players visible in the image
- If table has headers, use them to identify fields
- **CRITICAL**: For names, use ONLY first name + first surname (drop second surname)
