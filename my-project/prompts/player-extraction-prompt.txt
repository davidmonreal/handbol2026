Extract all player information from this image and return ONLY a valid JSON array. Do not include markdown, code blocks, or any other text.

**Required format:**
[
  {
    "name": "First Name + First Surname",
    "number": 7
  }
]

**Field rules:**
- name: First name + first surname ONLY. Be careful with compound names (e.g., "Josep Maria Rodríguez Pons" -> "Josep Maria Rodríguez", "Juan Antonio Garcia Nieto" -> "Juan Antonio Garcia"). If player has multiple surnames (e.g. "Perez Garcia"), use only the first one. Normally, for spanish names, you will fins two surnames so, if there are four words, the first two should be the name. Be smart about this. If not visible, use "Unknown Player"
- number: Jersey/dorsal number as integer. If not visible, use 0

**Important:**
- Return ONLY the JSON array, nothing else
- Do not wrap in markdown code blocks
- Do not include explanations
- Extract all players visible in the image
- If table has headers, use them to identify fields
- **CRITICAL**: For names, use ONLY first name + first surname (drop second surname)
